## Localization

The application uses a custom localization system based on JSON files:

- Translations are stored in `public/locales/{cs,en}.json`
- Language detection order:
  1. Cookie (NEXT_LOCALE)
  2. Browser language
  3. Fallback to 'cs'
- Language switching is persisted in cookies

### Adding Translations

1. Add new translation keys to both `cs.json` and `en.json`
2. Use the `useTranslations` hook in your components:

```tsx
import { useTranslations } from '@/app/context/TranslationContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { translations } = useTranslations();
  return <div>{translations.path.to.key}</div>;
}
```

### Adding New Language

1. Create a new JSON file in `public/locales/`
2. Copy the structure from an existing language file
3. Update `TranslationContext.tsx` to include the new language

## Theme Support

The application supports light and dark themes:

- Theme selection is persisted in localStorage
- Automatic system theme detection
- Manual toggle via ThemeSwitcher component
